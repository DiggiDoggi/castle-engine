# iOS example using CGE as a dynamic library to load and visualize 3D models

To compile, you need to install CocoaPods, see [the Manual](https://castle-engine.io/ios).

Then,

1. run `pod install` in Terminal inside the main ios_tester directory
2. open **ios_tester.xcworkspace** (not the xcodeproj!) in Xcode
3. select your team in the project settings for Code Signing
